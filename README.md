# React - Final evaluation - Rick and Morty.

The purpose of this exercise was to build an SPA, which renders a list of the characters from the famous TV show 'Rick and Morty', getting all the information from an API. It has two ways of filtering the data: by name and by species. If you look up a non-existen character, it will display a "not found" message.

By using Dynamic Routing, you can click on each character card and it takes you to a card with more details about the characters. You can also go back to the "homepage" by clicking on "return".

Shareable links: you can copy and paste the URL on your browser. If you paste the wrong URL it will give you an error message.

The rendered list is sorted by alphabetical order.

If you want to work with the code, you just need to download it, npm install and npm start!
